/**
The function `map-deep-get` is a custom function written in a Sass/SCSS stylesheet. Its purpose is to retrieve a nested value from a map (also known as a dictionary or associative array) using a variable number of keys.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function is defined using the `@function` directive and named `map-deep-get`. It takes two parameters:
   - `$map`: The map from which the value will be retrieved.
   - `$keys...`: A variable number of keys that specify the path to the desired value in the map.

2. Inside the function, there is a `@each` loop that iterates over each `$key` provided in `$keys...`.

3. Within the loop, the `map-get()` function is used to retrieve the value associated with the current `$key` from the `$map`. The retrieved value is then assigned back to the `$map` variable, effectively updating it to the nested map.

4. After the loop finishes, the final value of `$map` is returned using the `@return` directive.

In summary, the `map-deep-get` function allows you to access a nested value within a map by providing a sequence of keys that define the path to the desired value. Each key is used to access a nested map until the final value is reached, which is then returned.
